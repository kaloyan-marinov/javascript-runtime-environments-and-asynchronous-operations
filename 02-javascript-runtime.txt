A good working definition:
A _JavaScript Runtime Environment_ is a container,
which includes all the things
that are needed to execute any conceivable JavaScript program.

In practice, the term _JavaScript Runtime_ is a commonly used shortening of
the (technically more descriptive) term _JavaScript Runtime Environment_.

Examples of JavaScript Runtime( Environment)s:
(a) a web browser
(b) Node.js
    (it gives you access to the file system, network, and other things which arenâ€™t
    allowed in web browsers)
