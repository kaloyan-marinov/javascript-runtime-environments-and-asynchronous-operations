An analogy: Imagine a robot is putting out a fire.

    - The _JavaScript program_ would be the instructions to the robot to put out a fire.

    - The _JavaScript Engine_ would be the robot,
      which can understand the instructions and carry them out.

    - The _JavaScript Runtime Environment_ would be the fire truck and the water gun.

---

The _JavaScript Engine_ is composed of a _Call Stack_ and a _Heap_.

The _JavaScript Engine_ executes a script from the top and works its way down,
creating _execution contexts_
and pushing and popping functions onto and off the _Call Stack_.

---

_Web APIs_ are effectively threads that:
    - you can't access like threads
    - you can just make calls to [from your _generalized JavaScript program_]
      [even though they are not part of the JavaScript language itself]

it's within those pieces of the web-browser _JavaScript Runtime Environment_
where concurrency takes place.

---

Suppose _Event-Handler Functions_ are attached to several DOM elements.
    
When a "(thusly) dynamized DOM element"'s _Event_ occurs,
the _JavaScript Runtime Environment_ adds the attached _Event Handler Function_
to the _Event-Handler Queue_
without immediately calling/executing the function.

---

The _Event Loop_ is a constantly running process
that coordinates the tasks between the _Call Stack_ and the _Event-Handlers Queue_
and thus achieves concurrency for the execution of a JavaScript program.

---

It’s true that
the JavaScript portion of your _generalized JavaScript program_
is executed in a single thread.
But, it isn't true that
the whole _JavaScript Runtime Environment_ works in a single thread,
because the _Web APIs_ exist in the _JavaScript Runtime Environment_.

(
Fortunately, you don’t have to worry about thread management.

But how?

How does the _JavaScript Runtime Environment_ know when to execute your code?
If there’s only one thread responsible for the execution of your code,
there has to be some mechanism which manages the order of execution.

This mechanism is the _Event Loop_.
