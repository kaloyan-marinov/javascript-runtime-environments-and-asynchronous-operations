A _runtime environment_ (RTE) is a software system
that primarily implements portions of an _execution model_.

Sometimes, an RTE is also called a _runtime system_ (RTS).

Other times, an RTE is treated as just one of multiple components that make up an RTS
- in such a context:
(a) the RTS is defined
    as a specific part of the application software (IDE) used for programming,
    namely as a piece of software that provides the programmer a more convenient means
    for executing programs during their development, testing, and the like,
    whereas
(b) the RTE is defined
    as the very instance of an _execution model_ being applied to the developed program,
    which is itself then executed in the aforementioned RTS.
