# Introduction

The first few TXT files talk about two _JavaScript Runtime Environment_s: a web browser and Node.js. The components of each is defined and its responsibilites are described.

The last few TXT files define what an asynchronous operation is, list the only native functions of the JavaScript language to execute code asynchronously, and lists multiple ways of managing asynchronous operations.

The JS files provide examples, each of which can be executed by issuing `node <filename>`.

# According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary

1. Common language

    - _concurrent_: operating or occurring at the same time

    - _synchronous_: happening, existing, or arising at precisely the same time

    - _asynchronous_: not simultaneous or concurrent in time : not synchronous

2. In the context of digital communications

    - _synchronous_: of, used in, or being digital communication (as between computers) in which a common timing signal is established that dictates when individual bits can be transmitted and which allows for very high rates of data transfer

    - _asynchronous_: of, used in, or being digital communication (as between computers) in which there is no timing requirement for transmission and in which the start of each character is individually signaled by the transmitting device
